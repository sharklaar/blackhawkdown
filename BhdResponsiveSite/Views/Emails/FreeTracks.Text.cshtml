        Hi there rock fan

        Thanks for subscribing to our newsletter! Click here to download your free tracks: http://www.blackhawkdown.org.uk/home/freetracks/ 

        We've just finished getting our EP "Prefix" mixed and mastered, and we've got the artwork all sorted and ready to go.
        Soon we're going to have a big pile of beautiful CDs to be sending out to you lovely people, so please keep an eye out for an email update telling you where you can get a copy.

        We won't email you too often, and we'll only send you stuff we think you'll find interesting. However, if you ever want to unsubscribe, just drop us a line at websiteadmin@blackhawkdown.org.uk and we'll remove you from the list.

        Cheers
        BlackHawkDown
