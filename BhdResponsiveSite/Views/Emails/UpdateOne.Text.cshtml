We're just sorting out the details of our EP launch party and getting the CDs pressed, the release daet is still TDC but it's estimated to be early August - so keep watching this space for more news...

We won't email you too often, and we'll only send you stuff we think you'll find interesting. However, if you ever want to unsubscribe, just drop us a line at websiteadmin@blackhawkdown.org.uk and we'll remove you from the list.

Cheers
