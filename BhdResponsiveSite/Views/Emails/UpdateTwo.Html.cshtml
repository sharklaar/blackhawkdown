            Good evening BlackHawkDown fan!
        </p>

        <p style="color: white !important;">
            There's been a lot going on over here at BlackHawkDown and we thought we'd share some stuff with you guys - first up 
            we thought you might like to see the latest video from our EP "Prefix" - check out "Freeman" below!<br />

        </p>

        <p style="color: white!important; ">
            Also we've had a change of personnel recently - HEMY! has moved out of the area so our old (very old. Practically ancient) 
            friend Lee has stepped back in to take over on the guitar... welcome back, Lee :)
        </p>

        <p style="color: white!important; ">
            Next up, we've made a start on recording the next album, yet to be named... drums were tracked by Shark with Lee in the
            control room a couple of weeks ago. We'll have some updates and maybe some teasers coming your way soon... 
        </p>
        <p style="color: white!important; ">
            Cheers!<br />
