            <h2>About the Band</h2>
            <p>
            BlackHawkDown was born in 2010 when bassist Norb got together with self taught drummer Marc Daffern for jamming sessions with a couple of friends. Quickly lead vocalist Ben was brought on board and the riff and vocal line for 'Little Doorways' were developed along with a cover version of 'Shallow' by Porcupine Tree.
            </p>
            <p>
            Looking to start gigging the trio placed an advert locally for a lead guitarist and the call was answered by Andy 'Dirt' McGurk, a seasoned one man wrecking ball solo artist under the guise of Hollowtechnic. With the creative juices flowing, Norb and Andy began combining intricate bass melodies with raw and powerful riffs. Marc pulled it together with his brand of rythmic rock tub thumping and Ben polished it off with a mixed vocal style.
            </p>
            <p>
            'Shining Light', 'Poison in my Blood' and 'Times are Changing' were followed by 'Falling' and 'Simplify' as the band's style developed and evolved with the help of Lee Daffern who was brought on board as rhythm guitarist. A busy 2011/12 gigging around the UK saw the lads reach the regional finals of the Surface Festival at 02 Academy in Birmingham and play the massive East Midlands Willow Festival.
            </p>
            <p>
            2013 saw some troubled times, with the band parting ways with both Lee and Norb. At the end of 2013, HEMY! was brought in to replace Lee and Tom Michell stepped up to play the bass. The band spent much of 2013 recoring demos of their back catalogue of around fifteen original tracks.
            </p>
            <p>
            In 2014 BlackHawkDown will be back into gigging and promoting their new material!

            <strong>Instrument and why?</strong> I used to sing in productions years ago then drifted away from music. BHD were forming and needed someone who could hold a couple of notes.
